Here is the full code followed by the explanation:

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { label 'agentvindo' }

    stages {
        stage('Code') {
            steps {
                echo "It is cloning stage"
                git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/MAVRICK-1/simple-web.git'
                echo "it's cloned"
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo "It is building stage"
                sh "ls -lrt"
                sh "docker build -t node-app:latest ."
                echo "Build Done"
            }
        }
        stage('Pushed to docker hub') {
             steps{
                withCredentials([usernamePassword(
                    credentialsId:"dockerCred",
                    usernameVariable:"dockerHubUser", 
                    passwordVariable:"dockerHubPass")]){
                sh 'docker login -u $dockerHubUser -p $dockerHubPass '
                sh "docker image tag node-app:latest ${env.dockerHubUser}/demo-python-app"
                sh "docker push ${env.dockerHubUser}/demo-python-app"
                }
             }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo "It is the deploying stage ..."
                sh "docker run -d  -p 8000:80 my-app"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Line-by-Line Explanation:

1. **`pipeline {`**  
   Starts the pipeline definition.

2. **`agent { label 'agentvindo' }`**  
   Specifies the agent (or machine) where the pipeline will run. In this case, it runs on an agent labeled `'agentvindo'`.

3. **`stages {`**  
   Defines the stages of the pipeline, each stage will represent a part of the CI/CD process.

4. **`stage('Code') {`**  
   Defines the first stage called 'Code'. This is typically where source code is checked out.

5. **`steps {`**  
   Defines the steps that are executed inside the 'Code' stage.

6. **`echo "It is cloning stage"`**  
   Prints a message to indicate the cloning process is starting.

7. **`git branch: 'master', url: 'https://github.com/MAVRICK-1/simple-web.git'`**  
   Uses the `git` command to clone the repository from GitHub. The `branch` is specified as `master`, and the URL points to the repository.

8. **`echo "it's cloned"`**  
   Prints a message confirming that the repository has been cloned.

9. **`}`**  
   Ends the steps section for the 'Code' stage.

10. **`stage('Build') {`**  
    Defines the next stage called 'Build', where the project will be built.

11. **`steps {`**  
    Defines the steps for the 'Build' stage.

12. **`echo "It is building stage"`**  
    Prints a message indicating that the build process is starting.

13. **`sh "ls -lrt"`**  
    Executes a shell command to list files in the current directory, showing detailed information.

14. **`sh "docker build -t node-app:latest ."`**  
    Executes a Docker command to build the image, tagging it as `node-app:latest` from the current directory (`.`).

15. **`echo "Build Done"`**  
    Prints a message confirming that the build has completed.

16. **`}`**  
    Ends the steps section for the 'Build' stage.

17. **`stage('Pushed to docker hub') {`**  
    Defines the 'Pushed to docker hub' stage, which handles pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub.

18. **`steps {`**  
    Defines the steps for the 'Pushed to docker hub' stage.

19. **`withCredentials([usernamePassword( credentialsId:"dockerCred", usernameVariable:"dockerHubUser", passwordVariable:"dockerHubPass")]) {`**  
    This uses Jenkins credentials stored under the ID `"dockerCred"`. It securely retrieves the Docker username and password as environment variables `dockerHubUser` and `dockerHubPass`.

20. **`sh 'docker login -u $dockerHubUser -p $dockerHubPass '`**  
    Logs into Docker Hub using the credentials stored in the variables.

21. **`sh "docker image tag node-app:latest ${env.dockerHubUser}/demo-python-app"`**  
    Tags the Docker image `node-app:latest` with the user's Docker Hub username and a new name, `demo-python-app`.

22. **`sh "docker push ${env.dockerHubUser}/demo-python-app"`**  
    Pushes the tagged Docker image to Docker Hub.

23. **`}`**  
    Ends the `withCredentials` block.

24. **`}`**  
    Ends the steps section for the 'Pushed to docker hub' stage.

25. **`stage('Deploy') {`**  
    Defines the 'Deploy' stage, where the Docker container is deployed.

26. **`steps {`**  
    Defines the steps for the 'Deploy' stage.

27. **`echo "It is the deploying stage ..."`**  
    Prints a message indicating the deployment process is starting.

28. **`sh "docker run -d -p 8000:80 my-app"`**  
    Runs a Docker container in detached mode (`-d`), mapping port 8000 on the host to port 80 on the container. It uses the image `my-app` (make sure this image is available or is the name for the image built in the previous stages).

29. **`}`**  
    Ends the steps section for the 'Deploy' stage.

30. **`}`**  
    Ends the `stages` block.

31. **`}`**  
    Ends the pipeline definition.

This pipeline automates the process of cloning a repository, building a Docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, and finally deploying it to a server. It uses Jenkins for CI/CD with the help of Docker and secure handling of credentials.
